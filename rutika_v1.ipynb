    "Online advertising is a major business for internet companies and one of the core problem in that field is to be able to match the right advertisement to the right user at the right time. For ads on most websites and search engines, advertisers only pay for measurable user responses such are clicks on the ads and other actions that users take on the website such as registering, purchasing etc. Thus an optimal approach (as a search engine) is to choose an ad based on expected value, which is price of a click times the likelihood that the ad will be clicked. In order for websites to maximize expected value, they need to accurately predict the likelihood that a given ad will be clicked, also known as click-through rate (CTR)."
